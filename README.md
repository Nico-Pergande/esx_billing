# What does this script do?
My version of esx_billing has been edited to improve the RP. It is designed so that each person can pay his bill only where there is a ticket machine, for example. 
The positions can be set to your own liking in config.lua.

# Changes
- You have no longer to press F7 to open the billing menu, because there are only Ticketstations in the PD's to pay the bills.
- Added AdvancedNotifications for each action
